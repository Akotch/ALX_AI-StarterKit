NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) is a comprehensive suite of user-friendly microservices meticulously designed to expedite the deployment of generative AI models across diverse environments, encompassing cloud computing, data centers, and workstations. NIM caters to a wide spectrum of applications, including large language models (LLMs), automated speech recognition, and biological tasks.

In this project, we will explore various large language models deployed using NIM, which are available for free via NVIDIA. These models encompass a wide range of applications, from chatbots to 3D object generation.
