### Using Powerful Open Source and Proprietary Large Language Models For Free

![](https://alxappliedai.github.io/alx_applied_ai_assets/oss-models/oss-models-00.png)

Ever since we got introduced to **ChatGPT**, we have been exploring the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. We’ve used them for tasks like summarization, question-answering, and text generation. Then **Google’s Gemini** and **Claude AI** joined the scene, and we’ve used them for content creation, code snippet generation, and personal use.

However, the landscape of large language models is far wider than these proprietary models/services. Even though we can access them for free, we can do so much more with other language models as well without requiring any installation or beefy hardware.

This project explores how to use free LLM models, both open-source and proprietary, for various tasks.
