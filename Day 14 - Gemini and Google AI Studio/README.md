Google’s advanced AI model, Gemini, offers a wide range of capabilities. This project will first introduce you to interacting with Gemini directly, understanding its core functionalities. We will then transition to Google AI Studio, a platform powered by Gemini, that provides a user-friendly environment for further experimentation.

This project aims to provide you with the necessary information to begin using both effectively. We’ll cover the fundamental aspects of interacting with Gemini and navigating Google AI Studio, demonstrating how to perform common tasks, enabling you to explore its capabilities for your specific needs.
