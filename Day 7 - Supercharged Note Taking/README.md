## Supercharged Note Taking

![](https://alxappliedai.github.io/alx_applied_ai_assets/supercharged_notes/super-charged-notes-00.png)

There is no reason why note-taking applications cannot utilize AI features like autocomplete functionality. While autocomplete is commonly found in code editors, these boundaries do not limit its application to note-taking applications.

Having an autocomplete feature in a note-taking app can save you time and effort when writing notes by suggesting words and ideas based on your previous entries and writing patterns

If you enjoy taking notes for diverse purposes as we do, you will find this project very useful.
