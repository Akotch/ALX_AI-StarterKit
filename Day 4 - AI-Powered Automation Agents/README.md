The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into everyday life and business operations is subtly enhancing how tasks, from the mundane to the complex, are executed and managed.

## AI powered automation agents

Artificial intelligence-powered automation agents are intelligent systems or software programs designed to autonomously execute tasks, make decisions, or manage processes using AI technologies. These agents employ machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, or other AI techniques to emulate human-like problem-solving and enhance efficiency.

AI-powered automation agents are taking over repetitive tasks with remarkable efficiency, increasing personal productivity and freeing up our time to tackle more complex challenges or even spend more time on something we love to do, including building more AI tools!

In this project, we will build a workflow agent that, when you save a job announcement via a Google form, takes those details, writes a customized cover letter, re-writes your cv to match the job requirements, drafts you a letter to the hiring manager, and sends you the email with all the details so you can verify and submit!
